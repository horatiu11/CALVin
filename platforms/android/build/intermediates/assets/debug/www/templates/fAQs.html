    			<h4>1.	What is CALVin?</h4>
    			<h5>Calvin is a unique, multi-platform app that augments the learning experience for those studying and learning English. It is focused on aiding the learners’ English pronounciation of different groups of words, which are grouped by different mouth positions.</h5>

    			<h4>2.	Who is CALVin aimed at?</h4>
    			<h5>CALVin is aimed at all learners of the English language, whether they are young or old, or advanced or new in their English language studies. However, we feel that the app will particularly benefit those who are familiar with technology (i.e. those who are younger), rather than older people who are learning English.</h5>

    			<h4>3.	How do I use CALVin?</h4>
    			<h5>Using the app is easy; simply click the “try it out” button, and choose a vowel category. From there, you can practice pronouncing example sets of words to help you learn the different vowel sounds. The vowels have different articulation points in the mouth, and you can learn these by studying the animated diagrams provided with each set of words. You also have a recording bar where you can record the way you pronounce the word and compare it with the actual pronunciation. In order to register, just keep the red recording button pressed while you speak. As soon as you release it, the recording will be automatically saved. You can use the other buttons to play, pause or stop it. Pay attention: everytime you record, the old recording will be removed.<br> After clicking a certain word, you will have two additional similar words displayed for extra practice. Moreover, a set of images will appear at the top which provide details about what you need to know when pronouncing the word you clicked. You can navigate through these by swiping left/right. Finally, for each word, the bottom most button will launch an animation that shows how the specific vowel is pronounced within the word.</h5>

    			<h4>4.	What do I do if the app stops working?</h4>
    			<h5>Restart your phone. If this still makes no difference, then uninstall and reinstall the app. This should get it working again. If the error still persists, please use the “contact us” form on the app homescreen.</h5>

    			<h4>5.	What do I do if I’ve finished all the example words?</h4>
    			<h5>There are sets of extra practice words for you to try, at the bottom of each set of vowels. For more examples beyond these, we suggest that you listen to spoken English online, using YouTube for example.</h5>
